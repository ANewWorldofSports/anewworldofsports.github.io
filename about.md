An open sourced, version controlled approach at covering the sports we love!

### More Information

This is an attempt to keep up with the ever changing world of sports, while allowing anyone interested to participate.

The concept is open source, by allowing anyone interested to contibute.  Catch up with us on GitHub, add an article to our coverage topic and our editors will review the content.  They may suggest some edits, if you accept the changes adjust the article accordingly and resubmit.  The article will then get pulled into the next update of the blog.

The goal is to keep up with sports, in a dynamic environment, by allowing anyone with a voice to be heard while also rewarding our contributors.  In order to reward those involved we are working on defining a profit sharing scheme.  This will be driven by traffic.  The author will get a majority cut, while the editors will also get a cut.  The website will take a flat cut, that cut will be driven by expenses and will change as the site evolves.  We will do our best to communicate changes in our costs along with the percentages that we will be divying up between contributors and editors.

If you are interested in getting involved at any level please just contact us.  This is in the infacy stages, the website needs to be formatted and setup to pull in content dynamically.  This will be the main focus for now, once setup is complete we will go live with content.
